# 1.i will use bolt.new

2.tech stack :
combination of python for ai brain automation and nodejs for evnet drive in it .
framework :choose the best .
3.hugging face transformers or llama.cpp
4.choose the best for a webapp we are making on it
5.docker if needed
6.database choose the best what about neon or supabase.
7.vercel but i want to try render.com
write a project readme file just like what we write for claudecode which is called claude.md write this time for bolt.new . in claudecode we write the claude.md so the claudecode would know and can reflect to via using the claude.md file on the project it working on . just like that i want a file on this project for bolt.new . and don't forget to add things i forget to mention here but are important aspect of the project all the important this is missed and choose the best for a web app should
be and then write the bolt.new version of claude.md

Here’s a comprehensive **bolt.md** (your “Claude.md” style) project definition file for a modern Agentic Browser Plugin webapp, optimized for bolt.new and including all essential and advanced choices—and suitable for collaborative, high-quality AI agentic app development:

***

# bolt.md

## Project: Agentic Browser Plugin WebApp using GPT-OSS 20B

**Overview:**
A browser automation agent platform enabling users to browse, extract, and automate web tasks via an intuitive web interface powered by OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B. Fully modular, scalable, and production-ready, built for rapid iteration and cloud deployment.

***

## 1. Tools \& Environment

- **IDE \& Workspace:**
    - bolt.new (primary, all-in-one cloud IDE for code, preview, and deployments)
    - Optional: VSCode/JetBrains with remote dev if needed

***

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Back End:**
    - *Python 3.11+ (AI logic, browser-control, GPT-OSS 20B orchestration)*
        - Framework: **FastAPI** (async, production-ready, Pythonic, integrates well with agentic libraries)
    - *Node.js 20+ (event-driven tasks, real-time, extensibility)*
        - Framework: **NestJS** (TypeScript-first, modular, scalable microservices with integrated events)
    - **Agent Orchestration:**
        - *LangChain* (multi-agent orchestration, memory, chaining LLM and tools)
        - Optionally, *AutoGen* or *SuperAGI* (for multi-agent advanced workflows)
- **Front End:**
    - **Next.js 15+** (React/TypeScript, best SSR/SSG, flexible, Vercel/Rendable)
    - **Tailwind CSS** (rapid, maintainable responsive UI)
    - **shadcn/ui** or **Material UI** (component library for fast prototyping)

***

## 3. AI Model Integration

- **Model:** OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B
    - Loaded via **Hugging Face Transformers**
    - **llama.cpp** (optional for on-device or quantized local runs)

***

## 4. Browser Automation

- **Playwright** (best for Python; robust, async support, modern browser features)
    - Use Node.js version for edge cases or headless runs if desired

***

## 5. Database

- **Neon** (serverless Postgres, branching support, scalable, modern; preferred)
- Alternate: **Supabase** (if built-in auth, storage, and realtime needed; compatible with Postgres)

***

## 6. Cloud \& Infrastructure

- **Docker** (containerization for dev/prod parity and scaling)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (default), integrates with Bolt, Vercel, and Render.com

***

## 7. Deployment

- **Vercel** (front-end, global CDN, dev previews)
- **Render.com** (back-end Python/Node microservices or tasks, DB)
- Optionally, **Hugging Face Spaces** for model serving demos

***

## 8. Important Software/Dev Notes

- **Monorepo** using Turborepo or Nx for unified management
- **.env.example** for all secret/config needs (Store secrets in Bolt/Vercel/Render dashboard)
- **Sentry** or **LogRocket** (monitoring)
- **Prettier/ESLint** for code style
- **Tests:** Pytest (backend), Jest (frontend/api)
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** (auto-generated FastAPI docs)
- **Rate limiting, CORS, and security best practices enabled by default**
- **User authentication:** NextAuth or Supabase Auth if app is multi-user/SaaS

***

## 9. Quickstart

```bash
# Clone & install monorepo
git clone <repo>
cd agent-bolt
pnpm i # or yarn/npm

# Start back-end
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d # for local Postgres & distributed services

# Start front-end
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev # or yarn dev

# for bolt.new: open project, adjust environment configs as needed, deploy previews
```


***

## 10. Core Features

- Conversational agentic UI (prompt + action + browser feedback)
- Supports resource-intensive jobs using event-driven Node.js and concurrent Python
- Multisession, history, and team collaboration (if enabled)
- Secure API endpoints, robust error/logging, healthchecks
- Modular—add new tools (RAG, file upload, other models) with minimal effort

***

## 11. Additional Notes

- Follow the **bolt.md** as the single source of truth. All autosetup, scripts, deployment, and semantic conventions derive from this.
- For all updates, describe changes here so the agent and users remain in sync.
- Adhere to privacy and responsible AI standards—log sensitive tasks only with user consent.
- Use latest LTS versions for all tools (upgrade checks in CI).

***

## 12. Diagrams

[Include a system architecture diagram and API schema reference in `/docs` folder.]

## 13. Attribution

Project uses open-source components per their licenses.
Original template: Authored for bolt.new, 2025, with inspiration from Claude.md for claudecode.

***

With this **bolt.md**, human collaborators, AI agents, and bolt.new will have a single structured, opinionated, and self-documenting project definition—maximizing clarity, scalability, and state-of-the-art developer experience.
